There is a box (or rather, many boxes) containing 1d10 dollar
bills. There is a label on the box with the number (number of dollars
in the box)+1d10 on it.

If you have many boxes so labeled, picking the one with the largest
number on its label will tend to get you a box with a large divergence
between the number on the label and the number of dollars within. We
think.

These programs explore this problem.
